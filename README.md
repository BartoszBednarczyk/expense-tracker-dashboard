<h2>What's that?</h2>
<p>Expense tracker dashboard is a web app that helps you tracks your payments. You can add them in several categories as an expense or income and all of them will be visible on charts. It's integrated with firebase so you can create your own account and use it on every device. It's possible to use it at the moment but work's still in progress as I'm planning to add History with filtering and sorting options, more advanced charts and voice assistant.</p>
